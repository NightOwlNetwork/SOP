# File Access SOP:
### Author: Connie Uribe Chavez
#### Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to define Active Directory file permissions management.
#### Scope:
[What areas of the organization will be affected.]

#### Responsibilities:
Night Owls Network Administrators will be in charge of granting access, modifying permissions, and revoking access to the file share.

#### Prerequisites:
[The information, resources, permissions, etc. required to execute this procedure.]

#### Procedure:
[The outline of the activities or sequence of steps for performing the procedure. This should not be overly detailed -- let it capture the shape of the activity to be performed, regardless of how the details of its implementation might change.]

Begin with a flow chart map of the parts of the procedure being defined. This will become your outline
Bundle closely related tasks together for concision, especially if they always occur together/in sequence without much deviation
Work to have 5-7 tasks -- too few and it's not worth reading; too many and it's too hard to read. This is about parsing.
Now revise the flowchart to match the way you have bundled steps and number each steps
Write a concise, focused description for each step
Add a brief opening overview paragraph to describe the topic , inputs, outputs, expected results, and involved roles
