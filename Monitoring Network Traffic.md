# Monitoring Network Traffic SOP:
### Author: Connie Uribe Chavez
#### Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to establish guidelines for monitoring network traffic on the cleanpower to ensure the security and reliability of the network.

#### Scope:
This SOP applies to all personnel who have access to the CleanPower network and are responsible for monitoring network traffic.

#### Responsibilities:
The following are the responsibilities of the personnel involved in monitoring network traffic:

- Network administrators are responsible for configuring the network monitoring tools and ensuring that they are functioning properly.
- Security analysts are responsible for analyzing network traffic to detect any potential security threats or breaches.
- IT support staff are responsible for responding to any network issues reported by the network monitoring tools.

#### Prerequisites:
The following prerequisites must be met before implementing this SOP:
- Network monitoring tools must be installed and configured on the Night Owl Network.
- Personnel involved in monitoring network traffic must be trained on the use of the network monitoring tools.

#### Procedure:
The following procedures must be followed to monitor network traffic on the CleanPower Network:
1. Configure network monitoring tools: Network administrators must configure the network monitoring tools to capture all network traffic and store it in a centralized location for analysis.
2. Monitor network traffic: Security analysts must regularly review the network traffic logs to identify any potential security threats or breaches. They should also review logs in response to any suspicious activity reported by the monitoring tools.
3. Analyze network traffic: Security analysts must analyze the network traffic logs to determine the nature and severity of any security threats or breaches. They should also document their findings and notify the appropriate personnel of any significant incidents.
4. Respond to network issues: IT support staff must respond to any network issues reported by the monitoring tools in a timely manner. They should also document their actions and communicate with network administrators and security analysts as needed.

#### Policy -- This policy will be followed by Night Owl Network administrators
#### SOP -- Traffic monitoring should be done on a daily basis or more oftern if needed.
