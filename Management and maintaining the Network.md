#### Scope:
This SOP applies to all members of the IT department responsible for network management and maintenance.
#### Responsibilities:
1. IT Manager: The IT manager is responsible for overseeing the network management and maintenance procedures, ensuring that the SOP is up-to-date, and providing support to the IT team as needed.

2. Network Administrator: The network administrator is responsible for implementing and maintaining the network infrastructure, including switches, routers, firewalls, and other network devices. The administrator will also manage user accounts and permissions, monitor network traffic, and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

3. Help Desk Technician: The help desk technician is responsible for assisting end-users with network-related issues. They will document reported issues, escalate complex issues to the network administrator, and follow up with end-users to ensure that issues are resolved.

#### Prerequisites:

Training: All members of the IT department responsible for network management and maintenance must receive regular training to stay up-to-date with industry best practices and new technologies.
Awareness: End-users must be made aware of network policies, security measures, and best practices to ensure that they are using the network in a safe and secure manner.

#### Procedure:
Maintenance 
Verify the performance of the network and all internetwork devices in the network
Baseline the performance of the network itself

Identify and troubleshoot potential network issues

1. Approval: All changes to the network, including device configurations, software updates, and security policy changes, must be approved by the IT manager before implementation.
2. Documentation: All changes must be documented in the centralized documentation system, including the reason for the change, the proposed solution, and any potential impacts on the network.
3. Testing: Changes must be tested in a non-production environment before implementation to ensure that they do not cause any adverse effects on the network or end-users.
4. Implementation: Changes will be implemented during a predetermined maintenance window to minimize disruption to end-users.
