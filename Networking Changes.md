### Networking Changes authored by Nick


## Purpose:
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is designed to provide guidelines for managing changes to the network, including hardware, software, or configuration changes, with the primary goal of minimizing disruptions and downtime. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that changes are implemented in a controlled and consistent manner, with clear roles and responsibilities defined for all involved parties.

## Scope:
This SOP applies to all network changes, including but not limited to changes to network hardware, software, configuration, and security measures. This SOP covers all network changes made to production, development, and testing environments.

## Responsibilities:
The following roles and responsibilities are defined for managing network changes:

- Network Administrator: responsible for reviewing and approving network change requests, coordinating change implementation, and ensuring changes are completed as per the defined procedures.
- Change Requestor: responsible for submitting network change requests, providing all relevant details, and reviewing the implementation plan.
- Change Reviewer: responsible for reviewing the implementation plan and verifying that the change has been successfully completed.

Prerequisites:
Before implementing any network changes, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Change request: A formal change request must be submitted and approved by the Network Administrator.
- Implementation plan: A detailed implementation plan must be created, including a rollback plan in case of issues.
- Backups: All affected network devices must be backed up before the change implementation.
- Testing: Testing must be conducted in a development or testing environment before implementing changes in the production environment.


## Procedure:
The following procedures must be followed when managing network changes:

- Change request submission: The Change Requestor submits a formal change request to the Network Administrator, including all relevant details such as the reason for the change, the expected impact, and the proposed implementation plan.
- Implementation plan creation: The Change Implementer creates a detailed implementation plan, including the steps required to implement the change, the resources required, and a rollback plan in case of issues.
- Testing: The Change Implementer conducts testing in a development or testing environment to ensure that the change works as expected and does not negatively impact the network.
- Communication plan: The Network Administrator establishes a communication plan to notify all stakeholders of the change, including the scheduled maintenance window, and any potential impact or downtime.
- Change implementation: The Change Implementer implements the change during the scheduled maintenance window, following the implementation plan and verifying that the change has been successfully completed.
- Documentation: The Network Administrator documents all network changes, including the reason for the change, the implementation plan, testing results, and post-implementation review results.
